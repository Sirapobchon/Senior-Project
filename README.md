# RTOS for ATMega328P ‚Äì Senior Project

This is my Senior Project focused on embedded systems using the ATMega328P. It implements a lightweight RTOS using FreeRTOS v8.2.0 with support for dynamic task management via UART and persistent storage through EEPROM (and planned Flash integration).

## üìå Overview

This project is a **custom RTOS for the ATMega328P** based on **FreeRTOS v8.2.0**. It adds the ability to:
- Accept precompiled **binary tasks** via UART.
- **Store and load tasks from EEPROM**, and later Flash.
- Execute tasks dynamically using **FreeRTOS task scheduling**.
- Communicate with a **Python-based PC tool** for real-time task management.

## üîß Why a Bootloader?

Originally, the RTOS stored all task binaries in EEPROM. This was severely limited (1 KB total). To enable dynamic storage of larger, more complex precompiled task files, we developed a custom bootloader that:

- Executes before the RTOS (at 0x7000, the boot section)
- Receives `.tsk` task binaries over UART using a `<TASK:...>` format
- Writes them into the internal Flash beyond the RTOS (e.g., 0x2800‚Äì0x6FFF)
- Then jumps to the RTOS starting at 0x0000

This makes use of the ATMega328P's full 32 KB of Flash, separating RTOS (first 10 KB) and task storage (last ~20 KB), while retaining a small 2 KB bootloader section.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Bootloader Phase**
   - Runs on reset due to `BOOTRST` fuse
   - Listens for UART packets with `<TASK:...>`
   - Stores each task binary to a defined Flash offset (aligned, e.g. 0x2800, 0x2A00...)
   - Jumps to RTOS after upload

2. **RTOS Phase**
   - Begins execution from 0x0000
   - Reads stored task metadata from EEPROM
   - Jumps to appropriate Flash address to run preloaded `.tsk` tasks

Tasks are compiled externally with a custom PC-side Python tool that supports `.c` or `.bin` task files and prepares them for Flash storage.

## üîß Getting Started

### 1. Requirements

- **Flashing Utility:** AVRDUDE (for flashing firmware)
- **Compiler:** AVR-GCC 14.1.0 (If updated please change ver. in .bat)
- **Programmer:** USBasp programmer (for flashing ATMega328P)
- **Driver note:** For USBasp to function reliably, install the **libusbK** driver using [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/)
- **Task communication:** 
    - FTDI/USB-Serial converter hardware (FTDI232) (for UART communication)
    - PC Side Utility []
- **Optional** MPLAB X IDE with XC8 v2.50
    - Probably could be use with later version but didn't test
    - If you want to edit and rebuild the RTOS

### 2. Flash the RTOS firmware & Fuse Settings

To configure the ATMega328P to run from the bootloader section and support 8 MHz internal clock:

```bash
avrdude -c usbasp -p m328p -U lfuse:w:0xe2:m -U hfuse:w:0xd8:m -U efuse:w:0xff:m
```

- `lfuse = 0xE2` ‚Üí 8 MHz internal clock
- `hfuse = 0xD8` ‚Üí Enable BOOTRST, 2 KB bootloader size
- `efuse = 0xFF` ‚Üí Default

Check current fuse settings with

```bash
avrdude -c usbasp -p m328p -U lfuse:r:-:h -U hfuse:r:-:h -U efuse:r:-:h
```

#### To upload the Bootloader and RTOS code

Use the provided `.bat` or using the command for RTOS code

```bash
avrdude -c usbasp -p m328p -B 10 -U flash:w:dist/default/production/RTOS.hex:i
```

> üí° Use `-B 10` for slower SCK if you get sync errors.

## üß† RTOS Core

- Uses **FreeRTOS v8.2.0** with port for AVR
- Tick timer uses **TIMER1_COMPA_vect**
- **heap_4.c** is used for dynamic allocation and task buffer management
- All tasks run via a common executor (`vTaskExecution()`), based on the task‚Äôs `taskType`

## üß∞ Debugging Tools

- UART printing of task execution (`'T'`)
- EEPROM verification after writing
- Fuses fixed via `avrdude` (`lfuse: 0xE2` for 8 MHz)
- USBasp firmware flashing supported (`JP1` shorting to enter boot mode)

## üß™ PC-Side Utility

A Python-based utility is being developed to:

- Detect and select COM ports
- Send task management commands
- Upload task binaries using `<TASK:...>`
- Future: Compile AVR C code into binary tasks via `avr-gcc`
